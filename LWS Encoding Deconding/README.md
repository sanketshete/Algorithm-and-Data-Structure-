problem statement :
You have to implement the LZW algorithm and demonstrate it with fixed bit-length coding. However, the bit length N should be a command line argument. In practice, even though you will be using an N-bit representation for your codes (where N <= 16), you will treat each code as a primitive data type.
For example, in Java you can use a short (16 bits) or an int (32 bits) variable to store each code.
LZW Compression

This algorithm has two steps:
1. Encoding/Compressing
2. Decoding/Decompressing
